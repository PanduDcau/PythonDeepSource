# Super Resolution - OpenCV

**Complete Video Tutorial:** https://youtu.be/-LqHr5V67C4

## Project Information

The goal of this project is to enhance low-resolution images by using super resolution techniques with OpenCV and Python Deep Learning. Low-resolution images can lack details and appear blurry, making them unsuitable for use in certain applications. By using super resolution techniques, we can increase the resolution of these images and enhance their quality.
