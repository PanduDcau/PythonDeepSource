      "Thousands of queue-hardened Soviets on Wednesday cheerfully lined up to get a taste of ''gamburgers'', ''chizburgers'' and ''Filay-o-feesh'' sandwiches as McDonald's opened in the land of Lenin for the first time. The world's largest version of the landmark American fast-food chain rang up 30,000 meals on 27 cash registers, breaking the opening-day record for McDonald's worldwide, officials said. The Soviets, bundled in fur coats and hats, seemed unfazed, lining up before dawn outside the 700 seat restaurant, the first of 20 planned across the Soviet Union. The crush of customers was so intense the company stayed open until midnight, two hours later than planned. I only waited an hour and I think they served thousands before me, said a happy middle-aged woman who works at an aluminum plant. And it was only 10 rubles for all this, she said. I'm taking it back for the girls at the factory to try. Big Macs were priced at 3.75 rubles and double cheeseburgers at 3 rubles about two hours' pay for a starting McDonald's staffer or the average Soviet, but much cheaper than other private restaurants that have sprung up recently. The official exchange rate is 1.59 dollar per ruble but foreign visitors can buy rubles for 16 cents each, about what the currency is worth on the black market. Half the day's sales were donated to the Soviet Children's Fund, which provides medical care and assistance to orphans and disadvantaged children, Gary Reinblatt, senior vice president of McDonald's Canada, said from Toronto. The restaurant, built by the company in a joint venture with the city of Moscow that began 14 years ago, brought to 52 the number of countries where McDonald's operates. The previous opening-day record for sales was in Budapest, company officials said. Besides its restaurants in the United States, the leading number of McDonald's are in Canada and Japan, the officials said. Soviets got a first-hand look at such alien concepts as efficiency and fast, friendly service. Normally dour citizens broke into grins as they caught the infectious cheerful mood from youthful Soviet staffers hired for their ability to smile and work hard. Accordions played folk songs and women in traditional costumes danced with cartoon characters, including Mickey Mouse and Baba Yaga, a witch of Russian fairy tales. One Muscovite, accustomed to clerks who snarl if they say anything at all, asked for a straw and was startled when a smiling young Soviet woman found him one and popped it straight into his drink. For most customers, it was their first experience with a hamburger. Sandwiches were served in the familiar bag marked with the golden arches, but were packed in wrappers bearing Cyrillic letters, approximating ``gamburger.'' They tried them one-handed.They picked their sandwiches apart to examine the contents. One young woman finally squashed her ``Beeg Mak'' to fit her lips around it. ''It tasted great!'' a 14 years old boy said. It's a lot different from a stolovaya,'' he continued with a smile, referring to the much cheaper but run down dirty cafeterias that slop rice and fat or boiled sausage. Under the sign of the golden arches, accented by the Soviet hammer and sickle flag, hundreds lined up for the long awaited grand opening at 10 am on Pushkin Square, reaching out excitedly for McDonald's flags and pins as the hamburger chain's army fulfilled the Soviet penchant for souvenirs with Western logos. Publicity conscious managers had the staff shout ''Good morning, America!'' in English and Russian, for an American TV network. McDonald's of Canada Chairman George Cohon, the man behind the deal, said many people were buying multiple orders and the restaurant served 15,000 to 20,000 people in just the first five hours of operation. The restaurant limited purchases to 10 Big Macs per customer in hopes of preventing burger scalping. McDonald's built its own factory, including bakery, dairy, meat processing plant and even potato storage yard, to provide its own guaranteed supplies in a country where up to 25 percent of the harvest rots en route to the consumer. One McDonald's associate said the company wound up importing wooden crates from Finland for storing potatoes because when they went to build crates, they found there was no wood, and no nails. They found you need a permit to buy nails.\n",
      "Hurricane Gilbert, packing 110 mph winds and torrential rain, moved over this capital city today after skirting Puerto Rico, Haiti and the Dominican Republic. There were no immediate reports of casualties. Telephone communications were affected. Right now it's actually moving over Jamaica,said Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami. We've already had reports of 110 mph winds on the eastern tip. It looks like the eye is going to move lengthwise across that island, and they're going to bear the full brunt of this powerful hurricane, Sheets said. Forecasters say Gilbert was expected to lash Jamaica throughout the day and was on track to later strike the Cayman Islands, a small British dependency northwest of Jamaica. Meanwhile, Havana Radio reported today that 25,000 people were evacuated from Guantanamo Province on Cuba's southeastern coast as strong winds fanning out from Gilbert began brushing the island. All Jamaica-bound flights were canceled at Miami International Airport, while flights from Grand Cayman, the main island of the three-island chain, arrived packed with frightened travelers. People were running around in the main lobby of our hotel (on Grand Cayman) like chickens with their heads cut off, said one vacationer who was returning home to California through Miami. Hurricane warnings were posted for the Cayman Islands, Cuba and Haiti. Warnings were discontinued for the Dominican Republic. All interests in the Western Caribbean should continue to monitor the progress of this dangerous hurricane, the service said, adding, Little change in strength is expected for the next several hours as the hurricane moves westward over Jamaica. The Associated Press Caribbean headquarters in San Juan, Puerto Rico, was unable to get phone calls through to Kingston, where high winds and heavy rain preceding the storm drenched the capital overnight, toppling trees, causing local flooding and littering streets with branches. Most Jamaicans stayed home, boarding up windows in preparation for the hurricane. Some companies broadcast appeals for technicians and electricians to report to work. The weather bureau predicted Gilbert's center, 140 miles southeast of Kingston before dawn, would pass south of Kingston and hit the southern parish of Clarendon. Flash flood warnings were issued for the parishes of Portland on the northeast and St. Mary on the north. The north coast tourist region from Montego Bay on the west and Ocho Rios on the east, far from the southern impact zone and separated by mountains, was expected only to receive heavy rain. Officials urged residents in the higher risk areas along the south coast to seek higher ground. It's certainly one of the larger systems we've seen in the Caribbean for a long time, said Hal Gerrish, forecaster at the National Hurricane Center. Forecasters at the center said the eye of Gilbert was 140 miles southeast of Kingston at dawn today. Maximum sustained winds were near 110 mph, with tropical-storm force winds extending up to 250 miles to the north and 100 miles to the south. Prime Minister Edward Seaga of Jamaica alerted all government agencies, saying Sunday night: Hurricane Gilbert appears to be a real threat and everyone should follow the instructions and hurricane precautions issued by the Office of Disaster Preparedness in order to minimize the danger. Forecasters said the hurricane had been gaining strength as it passed over the ocean after it dumped 5 to 10 inches of rain on the Dominican Republic and Haiti, which share the island of Hispaniola. We should know within about 72 hours whether it's going to be a major threat to the United States,'' said Martin Nelson, another meteorologist at the center. It's moving at about 17 mph to the west and normally hurricanes take a northward turn after they pass central Cuba. Cuba's official Prensa Latina news agency said a state of alert was declared at midday in the Cuban provinces of Guantanamo, Holguin, Santiago de Cuba and Granma. In the report from Havana received in Mexico City, Prensa Latina said civil defense officials were broadcasting bulletins on national radio and television recommending emergency measures and providing information on the storm. Heavy rain and stiff winds downed power lines and caused flooding in the Dominican Republic on Sunday night as the hurricane's center passed just south of the Barahona peninsula, then less than 100 miles from neighboring Haiti. The storm ripped the roofs off houses and flooded coastal areas of southwestern Puerto Rico after reaching hurricane strength off the island's southeast Saturday night. Flights were canceled Sunday in the Dominican Republic, where civil defense director Eugenio Cabral reported some flooding in parts of the capital of Santo Domingo and power outages there and in other southern areas.\n",
      "Hurricane Gilbert swept toward the Dominican Republic Sunday, and the Civil Defense alerted its heavily populated south coast to prepare for high winds, heavy rains and high seas. The storm was approaching from the southeast with sustained winds of 75 mph gusting to 92 mph. There is no need for alarm, Civil Defense Director Eugenio Cabral said in a television alert shortly before midnight Saturday. Cabral said residents of the province of Barahona should closely follow Gilbert's movement. An estimated 100,000 people live in the province, including 70,000 in the city of Barahona, about 125 miles west of Santo Domingo. Tropical Storm Gilbert formed in the eastern Caribbean and strengthened into a hurricane Saturday night. The National Hurricane Center in Miami reported its position at 2 a.m. Sunday at latitude 16.1 north, longitude 67.5 west, about 140 miles south of Ponce, Puerto Rico, and 200 miles southeast of Santo Domingo. The National Weather Service in San Juan, Puerto Rico, said Gilbert was moving westward at 15 mph with a broad area of cloudiness and heavy weather rotating around the center of the storm. The weather service issued a flash flood watch for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands until at least 6 p.m. Sunday. Strong winds associated with the Gilbert brought coastal flooding, strong southeast winds and up to 12 feet feet to Puerto Rico's south coast. There were no reports of casualties. San Juan, on the north coast, had heavy rains and gusts Saturday, but they subsided during the night. On Saturday, Hurricane Florence was downgraded to a tropical storm and its remnants pushed inland from the Gulf Coast. Residents returned home, happy to find little damage from 80 mph winds and sheets of rain. Florence, the sixth named storm of the 1988 Atlantic storm season, was the second hurricane. The first, Debby, reached minimal hurricane strength briefly before hitting the Mexican coast last month.\n",
      "An explosion today flattened a military barracks and tore through nearby homes, killing 11 people and injuring 22, police said. The IRA claimed responsibility for the blast. More than 100 rescue workers frantically dug through the rubble of a three-story building that collapsed at the Royal Marines School of Music near Deal. Stunned neighbors gathered outside homes that were damaged or destroyed. Chief Police Inspector Alan Butterfield of Kent, who who provided the casualty figures and coordinated the rescue effort, first reported that one person was missing but later said everyone was accounted for. He said many of the injured were seriously hurt. There was a terrific crash which reminded me of the Blitz. After that, the ceiling started to fall down around me, said pensioner Joan Betteridge. Defense Secretary Tom King, inspecting the wreckage, said, It is not yet absolutely confirmed that it is a bomb, but all the evidence is quite clearly that this is an IRA atrocity. British military installations are a frequent bombing target of the Irish Republican Army in its campaign to rid Northern Ireland of British rule, but today's explosion in the coastal town 70 miles southeast of London was the worst IRA attack on the British mainland in more than seven years. The explosion occurred at at 8:26 a.m. in a lounge in thebarracks. One of the bands had just stopped playing on the parade ground, said a ministry spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping with British custom. Dozens of homes near the school were damaged, including four that were destroyed. Witnesses reported hearing the explosion two miles away. The Defense Ministry would not say how many servicemen and civilians were included in the casualty figures. However, King told reporters the attack was directed against unarmed bandsmen. Firefighters used heavy lifting equipment and thermal cameras to search through the debris, said Kent Fire Brigade spokesman Kevin Simmons. Ten doctors were giving emergency treatment at the scene and 11 ambulances were taking the injured to two hospitals, the ambulance service said. A statement telephoned to Ireland International, a Dublin news agency, said, we have visited the Royal Marines in Kent in response to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's visit to Northern Ireland nine days ago. The IRA said Mrs Thatcher went to the British province with a message of war,but we still want peace and we want the British government to leave our country. It was signed P. O'Neill, a nom de guerre the IRA usually uses to claim responsibility for actions outside Northern Ireland. Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey issued a statement in Dublin condemning the attack, calling it an outrage. The last IRA bomb attempt on the British mainland was in February when about 60 soldiers were evacuated from their barracks in Shropshire, western England, just before a bomb exploded. One soldier was killed and nine wounded in an IRA bomb attack on an army barracks in north London in August 1988. In July 1982, eight soldiers died in IRA bombings near the Household Cavalry barracks in central London and at a bandstand in the capital's Regent's Park where an army band was playing. Three people died later and a total of 51 were injured in the bombings. The music school is the training center for young recruits who want to play in the seven Royal Marines bands. Up to 250 young men, most between 16 and 20, are based at the school, where they receive military and musical training. The roof of Janet Minnock's house was torn off by the force of the blast and all the back windows were shattered. The house has been blown to bits, she said. We are all shaken up. Mrs Minnock's next-door neighbor, Heather Hackett, said she was standing at her kitchen window facing the barracks at the time of the explosion. She was holding her 4 months old son Luke in her arms with her other boys, Ben and Joshua at her side. I looked up from the sink and I just saw the whole building explode,she said. I told the boys to run and as Joshua turned a slither of glass embedded itself in his back. The whole window was blown across the kitchen. I just screamed and ran out of the room. The bang was so loud I thought the whole house was coming in. Sean Minnock said, I was asleep but woke up with a hell of a jolt. As workers tried to patch holes in his roof, he said: The bedroom ceiling fell in on me. I woke to find huge slabs of plaster on the bed and floor. I wondered what it was. As soon as I got up I looked out of what was left of the window and knew it was the barracks.\n",
      "Neighbors were breakfasting, heading to work or asleep in bed when an explosion at a military barracks turned their homes to rubble and they were confronted with the sight of bodies being carried away. There was a terrific crash which reminded me of the Blitz. After that, the ceiling started to fall down around me, said Joan Betteridge, a pensioner in the southern England town of Deal, where the blast at the Royal Marines School of Music occurred. The Irish Republican Army claimed reponsibilty for the explosion, which police said killed 11 people and injured 22. Nearby resident Sean Minnock said, I was asleep but woke up with a hell of a jolt, the bedroom ceiling fell in on me. I woke to find huge slabs of plaster on the bed and floor. From the wrecked, smoke-clouded barracks, I could hear terrified screams of agony. People started rushing about all over the place. It was horrible to watch and listen to, said Minnock. I knew people had been seriously hurt. I saw the rescuers pull out two bodies. I knew they were dead when they put them on the floor and put bed blankets right over them. Minnock's wife, Janet, said the roof of their house was torn off and all the back windows were shattered. The house has been blown to bits, she said. Mrs. Minnock was feeding her 2 years old son Thomas his breakfast when the explosion wrecked four terraced houses in the street backing onto the barracks. Her next-door neighbor, Heather Hackett, was standing at her kitchen window facing the barracks, holding her 4-month-old son Luke in her arms. Her other boys, Ben and Joshua were at her side. I looked up from the sink and I just saw the whole building explode,she said. I told the boys to run and as Joshua turned a sliver of glass embedded itself in his back. The whole window was blown across the kitchen. I just screamed and ran out of the room. The bang was so loud I thought the whole house was coming in. At first I thought for sure Joshua had been seriously injured. There was blood coming out of his back. Doctors removed the glass and sent him home. College student Simon Mitford, narrowly escaped being injured in the explosion because he got up earlier than usual. His room was completely wrecked by the blast, his brother Alex said. Of the barracks, he said, I heard music playing and then it went bang and there was glass everywhere. It was a two-story building but now 90 percent of it is rubble. I heard a marine scream out, The band is under there. I was scared there was going to be a second explosion.\n",
      "An explosion rocked the Royal Marines School of Music in a southeastern coastal town today, causing one building to collapse and killing eight people, officials said. Thirty people were injured and up to 18 were missing and feared trapped in the rubble. The blast occurred at at 8:26 a.m. in a lounge in the barracks near Deal, about 70 miles southeast of London, the Defense Ministry said. The building has collapsed, said a ministry spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping with British custom. We've no idea of the cause of the blast at the moment. It is too early to tell. Scotland Yard said a forensic team from its antiterrorist squad had been called in to help investigate. Firefighters used heavy lifting equipment and thermal cameras to search for those trapped in the debris, said Kent Fire Brigade spokesman Kevin Simmons. Kent police said 17 or 18 people were trapped. The Defense Ministry said seven were missing. Ten doctors gave emergency treatment at the scene and 11 ambulances took the injured to two hospitals, the ambulance service said. They are suffering from flash burns to their head and arms, fractures, and the sort of injuries you would expect after an explosion, said a spokesman for Buckland Hospital in Dover, 20 miles south of Deal. South Eastern British Gas sent investigators to the scene but said there was nothing to indicate the explosion was caused by a gas leak. Gas supplies to the barracks were cut as a precautionary measure, a spokesman said. Guy Platts, who owns a bookstore in Deal, located 20 miles north of the English Channel port of Dover, said he heard a massive explosion. There are dozens of ambulances, police and fire brigade making their way there. Military targets on the British mainland have been attacked several times by the Irish Republican Army in the past year as part of its campaign to rid Northern Ireland of British rule. One soldier was killed and nine wounded in an IRA attack on an army barracks in north London in August 1988. About 60 soldiers narrowly escaped death or injury in February when they were evacuated from their barracks in Shropshire, western England, just before a bomb exploded. In July 1982, eight soldiers died in IRA bombings near the Household Cavalry barracks at Knightsbridge in central London and at a bandstand in the capital's Regent's Park where an army band was playing. Three people died later and a total of 51 were injured in the bombings.\n",
      "Hurricane Gilbert slammed into Kingston on Monday with torrential rains and 115 mph winds that ripped roofs off homes and buildings, uprooted trees and downed power lines. No serious injuries were immediately reported in the city of 750,000 people, which was hit by the full force of the hurricane around noon. For half an hour, the hurricane lashed the city, tearing branches from trees, blowing down fences and whipping paper through the air. The National Weather Service reported heavy damage to Kingston's airport and aircraft parked on its fields. The first shock let up as the eye of the storm moved across the city. Skies brightened, the winds died down and people waited for an hour before the second blow of the hurricane arrived. All Jamaica-bound flights were canceled at Miami International Airport. Flights from the Cayman Islands, reportedly next in the path of the hurricane, arrived in Miami packed with travelers cutting short their vacations. People were running around in the main lobby of our hotel (on Grand Cayman Island) like chickens with their heads cut off said one man. A National Weather Service report said the hurricane was moving west at 17 mph with maximum sustained winds of 115 mph. It said Jamaica would receive up to 10 inches of rain that would cause flash floods and mud slides. Right now it's actually moving over Jamaica, said Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami. It looks like the eye is going to move lengthwise across that island, and they're going to bear the full brunt of this powerful hurricane, he said. Gilbert reached Jamaica after skirting southern Puerto Rico, Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Hurricane warnings were issued Monday for the south coast of Cuba east of Camaguey, the Cayman Islands, and Haiti, while warnings were discontinued for the Dominican Republic. High winds and heavy rain preceding the storm drenched Kingston overnight, toppling trees, causing local flooding and littering streets with branches. Most of Jamaica's 2.3 million people stayed home, boarding up windows in preparation for the hurricane. The popular north coast resort area, on the other side of the mountains, was expected to receive heavy rain but not as much damage from the hurricane as the south coast, where officials urged residents to seek higher ground. Havana Radio, meanwhile, reported Monday that 25,000 people were evacuated from coastal areas in Guantanamo Province on the nation's southeastern coast as Gilbert's winds and rain began to brush the island. In Washington, the Navy reported its bases at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, had taken various precautionary steps but appeared to be safe from the brunt of the hurricane. Ken Ross, a spokesman, said the Navy station at Guantanamo reported that as of 2:30 p.m. EDT, the brunt of the storm appeared to be passing southeastern Cuba. They have reported maximum winds of 25 knots and gusts up to 50 knots,said Ross. But there are no reports of injuries or damage. The spokesman said earlier in the day, Guantanamo had moved to Condition Two, meaning electrical power usage was cut back to only essential uses and all non-essential personnel sent to their barracks. The storm also skirted Puerto Rico without causing any damage to military facilities, Ross said. Sheets said Gilbert was expected next to sweep over the Cayman Islands, on its westward track, and in two to three days veer northwest into the southern Gulf of Mexico. Residents of the neighboring Caymans, a British dependency to the northwest, were urged to rush all preparatory actions. The National Weather Service warned that the Caymans could expect high waters and large waves which may undermine buildings along the beaches. All interests in the Western Caribbean should continue to monitor the progress of this dangerous hurricane, the service advised. Forecaster Hal Gerrish on Sunday described Gilbert certainly one of the larger systems we've seen in the Caribbean for a long time.\n",
      "Communism suffered its first Big Mac attack Thursday as McDonald's opened a restaurant in Yugoslavia, and police were called in to keep customers who lined up for hours from getting too unruly under the golden arches. I just wanted to taste genuine American hamburgers, said Milica Nikolic, a high school student who waited for three hours to taste her first Big Mac. People curiously examined the renovated restaurant's plush interior and the back-lit signs depicting the hamburgers, french fries, milk shakes and other fare more familiar in the West. It also featured amber-colored tables and floors, pastel-colored upholstery, modern art paintings and discreet illumination. The fast-food outlet, located on a downtown square, had drawn crowds in recent days, and they began gathering long before it opened Thursday. Police kept watch on the lines of customers snaking around the block, and they regulated the number who came inside to avoid overcrowding. No opening of a restaurant in Belgrade has created such a sensation as this one today, one policeman said. I think this restaurant has no competition in Belgrade, said Milica Danic, a housewife who treated her son to a cheeseburger. It is much cleaner, the service is faster, the interior is nicer and it is not too expensive. The Belgrade media have suggested that the success of McDonald's in Yugoslavia depends on its acceptance by citizens long accustomed to a hamburger-like fast-food dish called the Pljeskavica: ground pork and onions on a bun. In fact, this is a clash between the Big Mac and Pljeskavica, said Vesna Milosevic, an official of Genex, a Yugoslav state-run enterprise that has contracted a joint venture agreement with McDonald's. Our aim is not to destroy the Pljeskavica on the Yugoslav market, said Predrag Dostanic, managing director of the Genex-McDonald's. We want to change customs of the local people used to completly different eating habits. He said that lounging at tables for a long time after a finished meal will draw a warning. Also, smoking is forbidden and alcohol will not be served. This contrasts sharply with the Balkan and Yugoslav custom of sitting with a drink in smoke-filled restaurants and chatting with friends after the meal. The Big Mac meal, consisting of a hamburger, soft drink and french fries costs the equivalent of 2.57 dollar, or about as much the similar meal would cost in numerous Pljeskavica joints around town. Sadik Seljami, a waiter in a small Pljeskavica outlet just a few hundred yards from the McDonald's, suggested that the American restaurant wants to drive Yugoslav fast-food outlets out of business. However, we will not give up the fight even if we have to lower the prices, said Seljami. Glen Cook, an executive of the McDonald's Corp, said during the opening ceremonies, We are very excited about the opening of this restaurant, not only because it is the first one in a communist country, but also because it is one of the nicest in Europe. McDonald's and Genex contribute $1 million each for the flagship restaurant. They will also share the profits equally even though it will be managed entirely by Yugoslavs. The restaurant has 350 seats and employs 110 people capable of serving 2,500 meals per hour. In an effort to keep a high level of services, the management is entitled to fire any employees who fail to perform. The American corporation plans to open five additional restaurants Yugoslavia in the next five years. The next East European McDonald's, and the first in a Soviet bloc country, is to open next month in Budapest, Hungary.\n"
