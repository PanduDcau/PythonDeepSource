## Summary of the Project
This project is dedicated to the basics of **classification** in machine learning. This notebook looks over a proper machine learning workflow like exploring the data
and finding patterns within the data.

Then we'll use different estimators (algorithms) to classify if a patient has heart disease or not. Then we'll try to improve the best model with the help of GridSearchCV and do a lot of stuff
